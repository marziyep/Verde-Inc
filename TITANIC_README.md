It has started with cleaning up the data,in order to work with non-string datatypes, I encoded string typed columns like gender, embarked, and class into understandable values (0 and 1),So I chose proper data type for the rest of the columns. I noticed that values below one in the age column make no sense then I considered 1 to be the minimum. As soon as the whole data has been purified, it's time to use a different machine learning model,as it is obvious the chosen model should be the classification models (survived or not!). I divided cleaned data to test and train sets with test size of %20! I gathered all the data about accuracy of those model into a data frame, (title: comparing efficiency of different models on testing data), when it comes to comparison, logistic regression works somewhat better than the rest! we have two plots related to the questions; now we realize that although third class was more bustling than the others, the survival rate in the first class is the highest.
